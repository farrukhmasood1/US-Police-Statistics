# US-Police-Statistics
Explored police statistics in the US (2013â€“2021) to identify trends, racial biases, and systemic patterns using data science techniques.

Summary: 
This report investigates police killings in the US from 2013 to 2021, analyzing over 8,000 incidents to uncover trends, racial disparities, and systemic patterns. Using data from crowdsourced databases, the study cleaned and standardized 36 columns across 8,941 rows, focusing on factors like victim demographics, cause of death, and regional variations. Key findings reveal disproportionate killings of Black individuals relative to their population size, with racial biases evident in police actions across Republican and Democratic states. Machine learning models analyzed threat-level determinations, revealing systemic factors in police decisions. The report also highlights spikes in killings during events like Black Lives Matter protests and elections, emphasizing the need for accountability and reforms.
